# sunnyside-agency-landing-page-main
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.  This challenge focuses mostly on HTML &amp; CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.
